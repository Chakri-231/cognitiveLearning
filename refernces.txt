A Reference Architecture for Personalized Cognitive Education via Hierarchical Federated Learning

Abstract:-
In this paper, we propose a conceptual reference architecture specialized for multi-level personalized learning in digital education systems that utilizes hierarchical federated learning. The usage of different machine learning based models by educational institutions faces challenges due to the lack of sufficient training data, heterogeneous learner profiles, and strict privacy regulations. The proposed architecture addresses these by organizing the institutions into multiple hierarchical levels that leverage federated learning. The architecture also provides high availability and scalability, while still complying with stringent data-privacy requirements.

Using Machine Learning to Predict Cognitive Impairment From Functional Assessments: A Study of 274 Stroke Patients

Abstract:-

Cognitive impairment, which commonly occurs after stroke, adversely impacts rehabilitation outcomes. The administration of traditional screening tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) can be challenging for patients with communication or motor limitations. This study aimed to determine whether routinely collected functional assessments can effectively predict cognitive impairment in stroke patients undergoing robotic-assisted gait training with the Lokomat system. In this retrospective analysis, data from 274 stroke patients who received Lokomat-based rehabilitation were examined. Patients with complete data on the MMSE, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were included in the final analysis. Cognitive impairment was defined as an MMSE score <24. Five supervised machine learning models—logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost—were developed to classify cognitive status using FMA, MBI, and TUG as predictors. The performance of each model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. Logistic regression demonstrated the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.92, accuracy = 89.5%), followed by random forest (AUC = 0.88) and XGBoost (AUC = 0.87). FMA was identified as the most significant predictor in tree-based models. Patients classified as cognitively impaired exhibited significantly lower functional scores than their unimpaired counterparts (p <0.001). Functional assessments routinely performed during stroke rehabilitation can provide a practical and accurate method for identifying cognitive impairment, especially when cognitive screening is constrained. These results support the incorporation of machine learning–based tools into clinical decision-making during robotic rehabilitation.

Wearable RF Sensing System with Edge AI Inference for In-vivo Cognitive Load Classification

Abstract:-
Cognitive load (CL) refers to the mental effort required to process information. Monitoring increased CL is important as it can indicate the onset of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, allowing for early intervention and management. Traditional techniques using bio-physiological and audio-visual sensors are privacy-invasive and computationally complex. The synchronization, data alignment, and accessibility problems with these techniques can lead to increased noise and errors, reducing the accuracy of CL estimates. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind Radio Frequency (RF) based sensing system that effectively monitors and classifies cognitive load states by detecting cerebral blood flow variations through backscattered RF signal strength. The RF sensors are designed and miniaturized using microwave computational software and fabricated sensors are integrated with glasses to estimate in-vivo CL variations with on-edge processing and classification. The system is validated through user-oriented audio-only (AO) and audio-visual (AV) trials. Participants are tested on their ability to comprehend target speech with different levels of background noise, assessing the impact on CL. The statistical features from the RF reflection data are processed using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms implemented on a Raspberry Pi. The participants’ CL is classified into high, medium and low categories separately for AO and AV trials. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves an overall accuracy of 85% for AO trials and 66.2% for AV trials, with average training and testing times of 6 seconds and 0.001 seconds, respectively. The promising results suggest that the system is an effective, portable, and low-cost alternative for on-edge CL estimation.

Beyond Visuals and Audio: The Role of Olfactory Feedback in Enhancing Immersive Learning Experiences and Reducing Cognitive Load

Abstract:-
Immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology has shown its potential in education. Nonetheless, previous IVR applications have primarily focused on visual and auditory simulations, neglecting olfaction, which has limited the authenticity of the experience. Therefore, we conducted an experimental study with 64 students to investigate the effects of adding olfactory feedback to IVR on fire safety learning. The results showed that olfactory feedback significantly reduced cognitive load, elicited high-arousal positive emotions, and enhanced presence. However, it had no significant effect on learning performance. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications for the integration of multisensory stimulation with virtual environments.
